10
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:31,006
Today we begin with a Thinking Hint.


11
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:38,000
Everyone, how can you think about the next problem?

12
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:22,003
That is to say, these three.

13
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:42,006
Now, question 2.

14
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:47,009
Suppose there was one bacteria in this cup.

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,006
Within one minute, the bacteria divides

16
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:57,006
That is to say, after one minute, there's two bacteria.
In two minutes, four.

17
00:02:57,006 --> 00:03:02,006
In three minutes, it became eight.

18
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:05,009
The bacteria continues dividing.

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,006
In one hour the cup is completely full.

20
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:14,002
Now this is the question.

21
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:16,006
Within the one hour

22
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:20,006
there is a point where the cup is exactly half full.

23
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:23,009
This point where the cup precisely half full

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,003
how many minutes from the start is it?

25
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:46,003
Please think now. You have 30 seconds.

26
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,001
It's time.

27
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:18,006
This bacteria has a property of doubling each minute.

28
00:04:18,006 --> 00:04:21,009
You can think about this in the opposite way.

29
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,002
That each minute before, it continually halves.

30
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:31,002
That is to say when the cup is exactly half full

31
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:37,000
Is one minute before 60 minutes.
59 minutes after the start time.

32
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:44,000
We can think in reverse.

Now, today our problem deals with water and some scales.

36
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:56,005
Please look at these scales.

37
00:06:56,005 --> 00:07:00,006
We place a filled beaker on them.

38
00:07:00,006 --> 00:07:05,006
It's balanced.

39
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:10,006
Now, i stand like this right near the scales.

40
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:16,007
I raise my hand and, without touching the beaker...

41
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:24,003
gently put my finger in the water.
What will happen to the scales?

42
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:38,006
Well, let's give it a try.

43
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:45,006
We'll reveal the answer at the end of the program.

44
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:49,003
Think really carefully, won't you?

And now the answer to our problem.

48
00:09:11,006 --> 00:09:16,007
Did everyone think carefully?

49
00:09:16,008 --> 00:09:19,009
Well then, let's try it.

50
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's go.
Please look very carefully.

51
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
When I put the tip of my finger in, the scales shifted.

52
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,006
Why do you think that is, even though I only put my finger in the water?

53
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:45,006
When I put my finger into the water...

54
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:48,007
That part of my finger displaces some water.

55
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:51,002
Really, this...

56
00:09:51,003 --> 00:09:54,006
From here on we think for ourselves.

57
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:57,000
From here on we're all thinking crows.

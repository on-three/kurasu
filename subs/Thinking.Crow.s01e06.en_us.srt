Learn the way of scientific thought.

10
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:32,007
We begin with a ｢Thinking Observation｣.

11
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:39,006
If we make a loop out of paper, and cut through the middle with scissors...

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,006
It becomes two rings.

13
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:50,003
Today we will be observing this.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,001
This time we give it a half turn before attach it.

15
00:01:58,007 --> 00:02:03,003
And if we cut right down the middle with a pair of scissors...

16
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:15,000
it's twisted but it becomes one big loop.

17
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:25,000
Next, after an initial half turn, we give it one further half turn.

18
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:29,005
In total it's turned one full time, let's try cutting it.

19
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:44,000
It became two rings.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,007
It's twisted but it's two.

21
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:54,003
Why did the ring sometimes become one ring and sometimes two?

22
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:06,002
Let's try observing with color applied to both edges of the strip.

23
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:15,002
When we give it a half twist, it's connected like this.

24
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:24,006
If we traverse from here, red connects to blue.

25
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:28,009
And going around, it's connected to back to red.

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,007
We return to our inital position.

27
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:37,002
Is it that the red and blue line at the strinp's edge

28
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:39,007
is connected as one?

29
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:44,001
And thus...

30
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:50,001
it becomes one single loop?

31
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:57,003
Then what happened when we gave it a full turn?

32
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:10,007
Connecting red to red,

33
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:14,002
and blue connecting to blue.

34
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:18,006
If we cut this...

35
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:26,000
It becomes two loops, red and blue.

36
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:32,001
Then what will happen in this case?

37
00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:38,004
We draw three lines and connect a loop with a half turn.

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,009
If we cut the white part in the space between the lines

39
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
How many rings will will there be?

40
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:56,004
If we look at the place they join, first red and yellow...

41
00:04:56,004 --> 00:05:00,005
then yellow is connected to red.

42
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:06,003
Blue is only connected to blue.

43
00:05:08,002 --> 00:05:10,003

1. The spool will move away from our hand.

2. The reverse. It will go this way.

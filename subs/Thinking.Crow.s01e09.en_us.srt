Observe, then propose a hypothesis, experiment and consider results.

Lean the way of scientific thought.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,004
We begin with a thinking observation.

11
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:36,006
When we look at the water in a bathtub...

12
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:39,005
We can see it has some color.

13
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:46,001
It's greenish blue.

14
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:51,002
But water ought to be transparent. Why can we see a color?

15
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:57,001
Perhaps it's because we're looking at it in the bath.

16
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:00,003
Filling a glass. let's try looking outside the bath.

17
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:08,006
There's no color. It's clear.

18
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:12,006
To make sure let's compare to an empty glass.

19
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:19,002
The one with water has a little more color but

20
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:21,006
it's hard to tell.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,004
What will happen if we increase the number of glasses?

22
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:36,001
The light color has increased, and we can see blue can't we.

23
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:47,000
We can see blue.

24
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:54,007
But the water's color isn't significant.

25
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:59,009
Perhaps it's the color of the glass which makes the color visible.

26
00:03:03,004 --> 00:03:05,006
We prepare a long tube.

27
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:09,008
Both ends are closed.

28
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:15,006
We fill it with water via a hole on top.

29
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:23,004
It's full.

30
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:29,005
When we look from the side it appears transparent.

31
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:32,000
But when we look lengthwise...

32
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:40,003
it's blue.

33
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:47,002
It's quite similar to the color in the bath.

34
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:52,001
So is the water blue because of its depth?

35
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:58,002
Let's try comparig it to the bath water.

36
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:06,009
It's appears to be the same color but the blue in the bath water is a little deeper.

37
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:11,008
Is it because there's more water there?

38
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:15,007
Let's try pulling the plug.

39
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:20,005

Today's experiment

45
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:25,001
uses a clear super-ball.

46
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:30,002
We put the ball into a round glass of water.

47
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:32,005
If we do this what will happen?

48
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:37,007
It looks much bigger.

49
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:41,002
The glass is acting like a lens.

50
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:49,007
Now, this time...

51
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:55,008
we put a small sticker on the ball.

00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:18,002
We put the ball in the water like this.

Even though the ball looks bigger...

69
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:34,005
the sticker looks smaller.

Why do you think that is?

71
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:42,005
Well at first the sticker looked big because the light was bent.

72
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:46,003
Light has a property so that when it travels between different materials...

73
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,004
At that boundary the light is bent.

74
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,004
And the ball in the water...

75
00:09:50,004 --> 00:09:54,000
From here on we think for ourselves.

76
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
From here on everyone is a thinking crow.

We begin with a Thinking Observation.

11
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:39,009
Today we observe a strange pheonenon using coins.

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,002
Hold up a single one yen and two ten yen coins between your fingers.

13
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,008
This ten yen coin remains above.

14
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:56,002
The lower two coins drop.

15
00:01:56,003 --> 00:02:00,005
The one yen coin above and the 10 yen coin below.

16
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:03,005
If we drop these two coins...

17
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:10,001
The one yen coin ends up on top.

18
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:15,008
Did they switch en route?

19
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:18,000
Let's do it once more.

20
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:26,003
Once more the one yen coin went to the bottom.

21
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:30,002
As we thought they switched positions.

22
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:35,003
Let's try a different combination.

23
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:38,009
We add another 10 yen coin underneath.

24
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:46,005
Leaving the single ten yen coin above in place, we drop the three below.

25
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:50,001
Doing so, we confirm the three coins have changed position.

26
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:55,001
Will the one yen coin end up at the bottom?

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,002
The one yen coin ended up in the middle.

28
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:08,006
Let's try once more.

29
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:15,006
It's the same.

30
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:20,007
Let's try to organize this on paper.

31
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:31,002
At the start 1 yen 10 yen became 10 yen 1 yen.

32
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:38,000
Next if we add another 10 yen coin below.

33
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:40,004
It changed this way.

34
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:42,007
We don't understand this well.

35
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:48,003
What will happen with a different arrangement.

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,003
This time we dropped the one yen coin in the middle.

37
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:04,008
And it ended up underneath.

38
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:09,003
Let's also confirm this on paper.

39
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:15,008
Looking carefully at the results..

We will reveal the answer in the next program.

Today's problem uses a pendulum.

Grabbing the ball and release it.

This is a pendulum.

51
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:31,004
Actually, the pendulum we're using is special.

52
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:35,008
The weight at the end is a powerful magnet.

53
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:41,004
If we bring it close to a clip.

54
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:45,002
it sticks to it firmly.

56
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,006
But here we have prepared an aluminum plate.

00:06:59,006 --> 00:07:02,002
And to this

58
00:07:07,003 --> 00:07:09,004
it doesn't stick at all.

59
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:12,007
Magnets don't stick to aluminum.

60
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:15,008
Now this is the problem.

61
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:19,008
The aluminum plate that this magnet will not stick to

62
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:23,008
we place it on the desk.

63
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:28,000
And we separate the magnet from it.

64
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:33,008
If we do this how will the pendulum swing?

65
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:38,001
1. It will go slower than the case with no plate.

66
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:40,001
and stop.

67
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:44,009
2. Just the opposite. It will go faster and not stop at all.

68
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:50,004

3. It will swing the same as if there were no plate.

We'll present the anser at the end of the program.

And now the answer from earlier.

Everyone did you think carefully?

74
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,001
Then, let's do it for real.

75
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:39,004
First we try the case without the plate beneath.

76
00:08:43,004 --> 00:08:46,005
This is the normal state.

77
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:52,005
Now we try with the aluminum plate beneath.

78
00:08:55,003 --> 00:09:01,001
How do you think the pendulum will swing?
Watch really closely, won't you?

79
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:08,008
It stopped right away.

80
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:11,004
Let's try once more.

81
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:21,006
The answer is 1.

82
00:09:21,006 --> 00:09:24,006
It was "the pendulum will swing more slowly than the case without the plate

83
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:27,006
and stop right away."

84
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:34,003
But magnest ought not stick to aluminum.

85
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:38,001
Why should this happen?

86
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:43,001
This is connected to a propery between magnets and aluminum.

87
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:48,002
Magnets don't stick to aluminum, but it conducts electricity.

88
00:09:48,002 --> 00:09:50,002
And magnets and electricity...

89
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:53,005
From here on we think for ourselves.

90
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:57,000
From here on we're all thinking crows.

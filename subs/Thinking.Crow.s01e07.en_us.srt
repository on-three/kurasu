Learn the way of scientific thought.

10
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:32,004
We begin with a ｢Thinking Observation｣

11
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:40,001
An ant walking atop a notepad.

12
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,009
Let's try drawing a line across the ant's path.

13
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:02,006
It appears to dislike it but doesn't completely understand.

14
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:06,001
Again we block its path with a line.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It avoids the line.

16
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,008
This time we try to surround it with a circle.

17
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:37,009
Clearly it dislikes the line.

18
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:40,004
It's cut off.

19
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:47,007
It gets out, and we surround it one more time.

20
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:56,008
As we expect it's isolated.

21
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,003
Observe for a short while.

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,006
It got out. Is it already used to them?

23
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:16,006
It walks across the lines in equanimity.

24
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's try surrounding it with a new circle.

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,005
Once again, it has become unable to get out.

26
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:30,007
It appears it hasn't gotten used to it.

27
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:35,008

30
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,001
Today our problem deals with a magnet and some iron balls.

31
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:51,003
This is a magnet.

32
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:55,005
If I bring it near the iron balls...

33
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:58,005
they stick together.

34
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:04,002
But the iron balls themselves...

35
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:10,002
of course don't stick together.

36
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,009
Okay so far?

37
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:21,005
Next we affix the magnet to the desk with some tape.

38
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:31,002
Then we place another magnet of the same type atop it.

39
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:39,000
If we bring an iron ball close, it sticks.

40
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,005
Furthermore, we place one more iron ball atop...

41
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:51,000
and this also sticks.

42
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,003
Now, this is the problem.

43
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:59,008
What will happen if we raise the topmost iron ball?

44
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:05,009
1. Only the ball we're holding will be raised.

45
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:11,000
2. The iron ball beneath will also be raised.

46
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:18,005
3. Furthermore, the magnet beneath will also be raised.

47
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:23,006
Well then, what will happen?
We'll present the answer at the end of the program.

48
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:28,000
Everyone, think really hard about this, won't you?

Everyone, did you think carefully?

53
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:00,009
Now, let's do it for real.

54
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:03,000
Let's go.

55
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,008
The answer it number 1.

56
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:15,002
The two iron balls together are raised.

57
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:19,008
Further more, if we try to raise the iron balls a bit further.

58
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:22,005
What do you suppose will happen?

59
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:28,007
I was surprised...

60
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:33,000
it fell. Let's try that once more.

61
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:45,001
As we saw, it falls.
Why do you think that is?

62
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:49,001
When iron is brought near a magnet, instantly...

63
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:53,000
From here on we think for ourselves.

64
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
From here everyone is a thinking crow.

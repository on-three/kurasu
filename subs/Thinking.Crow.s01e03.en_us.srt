Lean the way of scientific thought.


10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,002
First we start with a ｢Thinking Observation｣


11
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:40,002
If we flick this pen cap with our finger...

12
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:43,006
Look closely.


13
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:48,009
Today, we will be observing this.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,006
Try putting a mark on the cap with a sticker.

15
00:01:55,006 --> 00:02:02,003
Watch the mark when we flick the cap.


16
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:09,003
Flick it once more.


17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,003
This time we can't see the mark.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,003
And if we spin it once more...

19
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:28,002
We see it.

20
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:33,006
What's the difference between the time when we can see the mark and when we can't?

21
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:37,000
Try spinning it some times.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We can see it.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We can't see it.

24
00:02:58,003 --> 00:03:01,006
We see it.

25
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:09,002
Watch carefully the position of our finger when flicking it.

26
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:13,006
Flick it on the side we've put the sticker.

27
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:22,003
We can see the mark.

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,006
This time flick from the side we haven't put the sticker.

29
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:36,003
We can't see the mark.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Confirm by placing a mark on the opposite side.

31
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:51,000
Flick on the circle side...

32
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:58,003
We can't see anything but the circle.

33
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:05,000
If we flick on the side with the triangle...

34
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:10,006
We can't see anything but the triangle.

35
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:19,002
But the circle and triangle and on the same side.

36
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:26,000
When we can see the circle, we ought not be able to see the triangle at the same time?


37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,003
but...

38
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:37,002
we can only see the circle.

Today our problem uses this balloon.

44
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,006
We affix this balloon to this trolley here.

What will happen to the balloon?

47
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,006
It tilted backwards.

What will happen to the balloon?

54
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:26,002
1. Like before it will tilt backwards.


55
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:30,002
2. It will do the opposite, and tilt forward.

56
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:33,009
3. It will remain as it is, and not tilt.

But why do you think that happens?

In things there is a property that tries to remain the same.

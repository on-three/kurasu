1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,009
｢there was a hungry crow｣

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,009
｢who wanted to get some feed｣

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,009
｢if only this beak were longer｣

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,006
that feed would be a bit closer

5
00:00:44,006 --> 00:01:00,009
｢a crow can think｣

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,006
｢can think... can think｣

7
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:17,002
Observe, propose a hypothesis, experiment, and then reflect.

8
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:20,006
Learn the way of scientific thought.

9
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:32,009
We begin with a ｢Thinking Observation｣

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,009
Today we observe the sounds a train makes.

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,005
This 'click-clack' noise. What's making it?

12
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:51,008
We observe from outside the train.

13
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:03,007
The 'click-clack' noise doesn't come from here.

14
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:09,007
Let's try moving.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,007
The 'click-clack' noise comes from here.

16
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:28,000
How is this place different from the last?

17
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:31,008
Let's try comparing the two places.

18
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:39,004
If we pay close attention to the rails...

19
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:48,006
Here, there's something attached to the rails.

20
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:57,004
Let's observe the noise while watching this place closely

21
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:07,002
Each time the train wheels pass here...

22
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:13,008
We hear the noise.

23
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:17,003
What on earth is this?

24
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:21,004
If we look very carefully...

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,004
there's a gap in the rails.

26
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:30,004
If we look from the side...

27
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:34,001
The crack widens.

28
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:39,009
Does the sound arise when the train wheels pass over this gap?

29
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:54,009
By shifting a desk, we tried to make such a gap at home.

30
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:03,001
It certainly does make a sound.

31
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:24,006

32
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:44,000
Well then, today our problem deals with a pipe and some balloons.

33
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,002
A large balloon and a small one are attached on either side of the pipe.

34
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:54,006
The two balloons are of the same type.

35
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:58,007
The interior of this pipe is hollow.

36
00:06:58,008 --> 00:07:05,000
But here there is a valve, which closes the pipe.

37
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,001
So therefore, the air in the two balloons

38
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:11,002
can't move freely between them.

39
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:14,007
When we twist here, the valve inside opens.

40
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:20,009
the air in the two balloons can then come and go freely.

41
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,001
Now this is the problem.

42
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,003
When I open this valve...

43
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:30,003
How do you think the balloons will change?

44
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:36,003
1 The large balloon will increase in size further, and the smaller balloon will shrink.

45
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:42,008
2. The large balloon will shrink and both ballons will assume the same size.

46
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:47,003
3. The balloons will remain unchanged.

47
00:07:47,004 --> 00:07:50,004
We'll reveal the answer at the end of the program.

48
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:55,002
Everyone, please think about it won't you?

49
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:11,006
Observation, hypothesis, experiment, and then reflection.

50
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:14,002
Thinking scientifically...

51
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:29,008
And now the answer to our problem.
Everyone, did you think carefully?

52
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:37,008
1. The larger ballon will grow bigger and the small balloon will shrink.

53
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:44,003
2. The larger balloon will shrink and both balloons will assume the same size.

54
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:49,004
3. They will remain unchanged.

55
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:51,009
Well then, let's try it.

56
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,003
What will happen to the balloons?
Watch carefully, won't you?

57
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:16,008
The larger balloon became even larger

58
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:20,000
and the smaller balloon shrunk.

59
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:22,003
Let's watch that one more time.

60
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:33,002
The answer is that the larger balloon will increased further in size

61
00:09:33,003 --> 00:09:37,000
and the smaller balloon shrunk.

62
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,007
Why do you suppose that is?

63
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:44,004
The secret is that inside each balloon there is air pressure.

64
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:48,002
Inside the larger balloon that pressure is lower...

65
00:09:48,002 --> 00:09:52,001
from here on we think for ourselves.

66
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:56,000
Now everyone is a thinking crow.
